In order for a relationship to be meaningful and ful\ufb01lling, it has to become deep. That\u2019s when you would \u2018hit a wall\u2019 when dealing with\u00a0avoidant attachment style and relationships. These individuals will let you be around them, but will not let you in. They tend to avoid strong displays of closeness and intimacy. As soon as things get serious, dismissive/ avoidant individuals are likely to close themselves off. At this point, such people might try to \ufb01nd a reason to end a relationship. They might be highly annoyed by their partner\u2019s behavior, habit, or even physical appearance. Consequently, they start drifting off and distancing themselves from the partner. Adults with this attachment style believe that they do not need emotional intimacy in their lives. This is a direct result of their upbringing. Their caregivers showed them that people cannot be relied on. Whenever they sought emotional support in the past, it was not provided. They simply stop seeking or expecting it from others. It\u2019s as if they have \u2018turned off the switch\u2019. To the avoidant adult, emotional closeness and intimacy are often off the table From the outside, an adult with an avoidant attachment style might look con\ufb01dent, strong, and together. This does not mean, however, that this person is not suffering or making those around him/her suffer. To the avoidant adult, emotional closeness and intimacy are often off the table. Not because they will not reap bene\ufb01ts, but because they do not know how. Either way, not being able to build a deep, meaningful, and long-lasting relationship can be painful for people with this attachment style. It can also be heart-breaking for the ones who love them. Furthermore, having an avoidant attachment style as a parent is likely to affect your child\u2019s attachment style.
