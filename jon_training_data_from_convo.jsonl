Because she was like liying to her therapist because she didn't want me to be the problem. So like this was the first time in like 5 years I actually understand how she feels. She wants like independence in things. Like doing the dishes herself because if I did their might be another reason behind it. She said that the time apart was great then I asked how she was doing and she took it as like me invading her feelings. Which she said like is not fair but since she has been like so tight that the almost took back the feeling of her missing me. To me it's been like 3 weeks since our fight. But for her it's been like 2 days. So it's going to take time. She said not to sound shitty but like i have to like come to you. I understand better now.
